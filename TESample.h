#	TESample is an example application that demonstrates how 
#	to initialize the commonly used toolbox managers, operate 
#	successfully under MultiFinder, handle desk accessories and 
#	create, grow, and zoom windows. The fundamental TextEdit 
#	toolbox calls and TextEdit autoscroll are demonstrated. It 
#	also shows how to create and maintain scrollbar controls.
#
#	It does not by any means demonstrate all the techniques you 
#	need for a large application. In particular, Sample does not 
#	cover exception handling, multiple windows/documents, 
#	sophisticated memory management, printing, or undo. All of 
#	these are vital parts of a normal full-sized application.
#
#	This application is an example of the form of a Macintosh 
#	application; it is NOT a template. It is NOT intended to be 
#	used as a foundation for the next world-class, best-selling, 
#	600K application. A stick figure drawing of the human body may 
#	be a good example of the form for a painting, but that does not 
#	mean it should be used as the basis for the next Mona Lisa.
#
#	We recommend that you review this program or Sample before 
#	beginning a new application. Sample is a simple app. which doesn�t 
#	use TextEdit or the Control Manager.

/*	Determining an application's minimum size to request from MultiFinder depends
	on many things, each of which can be unique to an application's function,
	the anticipated environment, the developer's attitude of what constitutes
	reasonable functionality and performance, etc. Here is a list of some things to
	consider when determining the minimum size (and preferred size) for your
	application. The list is pretty much in order of importance, but by no means
	complete.
	
	1.	What is the minimum size needed to give almost 100 percent assurance
		that the application won't crash because it ran out of memory? This
		includes not only things that you do have direct control over such as
		checking for NIL handles and pointers, but also things that some
		feel are not so much under their control such as QuickDraw and the
		Segment Loader.
		
	2.	What kind of performance can a user expect from the application when
		it is running in the minimum memory configuration? Performance includes
		not only speed in handling data, but also things like how many documents
		can be opened, etc.
		
	3.	What are the typical sizes of scraps is [a boy dog] that a user might
		wish to work with when lauching or switching to your application? If
		the amount of memory is too small, the scrap may get lost [will have
		to be shot]. This can be quite frustrating to the user.
		
	4.	The previous items have concentrated on topics that tend to cause an
		increase in the minimum size to request from MultiFinder. On the flip
		side, however, should be the consideration of what environments the
		application may be running in. There may be a high probability that
		many users with relatively small memory configurations will want to
		avail themselves of your application. Or, many users might want to use it
		while several other, possibly related/complementary applications are
		running. If that is the case, it would be helpful to have a fairly
		small minimum size.
	
	What we did for TESample:
	
		We determined the smallest heap size that TESample could have and still
		run (22K). For the preferred size we added enough space to permit:
			a. a maximum size TextEdit text handle (32000 characters)
			b. a maximum usable TextEdit scrap (32000 characters)
			b. a maximum scrap as a result of Copy (32000 characters)
			d. a little performance cushion (see 2, above) (10K)
		Result: 122K for preferred size
		
		For the minimum size we took the 22K and then scaled down our requirements
		for a,b, and c above. We thought that providing 16K more would be lean
		and mean (see 4, above).
		Result: 38K for minimum size
